## Overview

This project is a **modern, premium SaaS landing page and component system** for **Viversed**, a brand offering AI-powered productivity and creativity tools.  

The website is developed using **v0.dev** â€” an AI-powered frontend code generation platform â€” combined with React and Next.js for production-grade deployment.

It includes multiple pages for marketing, pricing, blog, and contact, featuring a dark, gradient-rich design inspired by top-tier SaaS sites like Framerâ€™s Landio and Xtract.

## v0.dev AI-Driven Development Prompt

To create this SaaS website, the following detailed prompt was used with v0.dev AI assistant (adapted for the basic/free plan) to generate the multi-page site and modular UI components:

> Design a modern, premium SaaS landing page and internal pages for a company called "**Viversed**" with a dark theme, black backgrounds and vibrant gradients (purple, blue, magenta).  
>  
> Use a modern geometric sans-serif font (e.g., Sora, Inter). Include a sticky navbar with brand logo and navigation links, a hero section with bold headline and CTA button, sections for "Trusted By", features grid with icons and descriptions, interactive product screenshot demo, testimonials, pricing preview with multi-tier table, FAQ accordion, newsletter signup CTA, and footer with social links.  
>  
> Create internal pages for Features, Pricing, Blog, and Contact with consistent styling.  
>  
> All UI elements should be designed as reusable, prop-driven components (e.g., Navbar, FeatureCard, PricingTable).  
>  
> Incorporate subtle animations and hover effects consistent with Framer-inspired SaaS design.  
>  
> Prioritize clean, modular code and a beautiful, intuitive UI with gradient overlays on dark backgrounds.  
>  
> Include mobile responsive design and interactive mobile menu.  
>  
> Follow a 3-column grid layout for navbar to center links horizontally.  
>  
> Deploy and document AI usage in a report.
